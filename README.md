# hangouts_meeper

hangouts bot to reply to messages and other random things.
not really any commits since I had personal info in the commits so I made a new repository

## Setup
all the logic revolves around reply_data.json; an example is in example_data.json. Requires a [login token for hangups](https://hangups.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide.html#logging-in) which should go in token.txt.

Runs on python3.7+, only dependency is [hangups](https://github.com/tdryer/hangups)
